  description: "Full-Stack Engineer (React, TypeScript & Python) | Building Scalable Web Systems, Automation & AI Solutions",
    detailedDescription: `I am a software engineer driven by a passion for scalability and clean code. Currently completing my B.Tech in Information Technology, I bridge the gap between complex backend logic and responsive frontend design.
    My technical foundation is built on real-world experience. As a Software Engineer Intern at Electronic Arts, I developed modular components in an Agile environment , and currently serve as a React JS Developer at Aigetai. I also bring a data-driven mindset from my time at Deloitte, where I specialized in modeling and visualization to uncover actionable insights.
    Beyond the workplace, I am an avid builder and open-source contributor. My GitHub portfolio features diverse projects ranging from "Jarvis-Ultimate," an AI-driven assistant , to automated Trading Bots and secure RBAC systems. Whether optimizing a TypeScript design system  or engineering high-speed data solutions, I am dedicated to shipping software that solves actual problems.
